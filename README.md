# job-agency

Django web application which allows registered users to create vacancies or resumes and see posted vacancies/resumes. Users can create resumes and superusers (recruiters) - vacancies.

The application is a solution to the JetBrains Academy project HyperJob Agency but additional features and tests were added.
